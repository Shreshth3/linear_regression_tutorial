# linear_regression_tutorial

Still in development! No guarantees for any code after the "TODO" Markdown Cell. Everything above that cell should work correctly.

For students:
    - Run git pull any time you come back to this notebook. This will ensure you have the most up to date version. This will include new curriculum, so do come back from time to time to see what's new!
    - DO NOT modify the original notebook, as this will make it difficult to get updates (you'll get merge conflicts). Instead, make a copy of the notebook, and work from that duplicate. Making a copy is easy! Open up your Jupyter Notebook homepage (the thing that pops up when you run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal where you can see all of the files in this directory), check the "Linear Regression Tutorial.ipynb" box, and then select the "Duplicate" button that appears near the top of the screen. Done! Feel free to modify this duplicate to your heart's content!
